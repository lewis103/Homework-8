Hidden Markov Model 
===================

(0) Indicates starting the test
(1) Indicates cheating
(2) Indicates passing the test
(3) Indicates getting caught/failing

From starting (0) you can either know the material and pass or try and cheat.

from (1) you can either get away with cheating and pass (2) or get cuaght cheating (3)

Since both passing (2) and failing (3) are an end result, thus there is a 100% chance or staying there.
