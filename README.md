Hidden Markov Model 
===================

(0) Indicates starting the test
(1) Indicates cheating
(2) Indicates passing the test
(3) Indicates getting caught/failing

In my Markov Model I simulated the chances of needing to cheat or knowing the material, and the chances of getting caught or passing. You start the test out, you either just sit there/no way to cheat (50%) either know the material (20%) or cheat (30%) from there you either pass or get chaught.
